unfill
======

Functions providing the inverse of Emacs' fill-paragraph and fill-region

### Installation

Preferred method: install from [MELPA](http://melpa.org/).

Otherwise:

    (add-to-list 'load-path "/dir/containing/unfill")
    (require 'unfill)

### Usage

    M-x unfill-region
    M-x unfill-paragraph
    M-x unfill-cycle

### unfill-cycle

By default ~unfill-cycle~ toggles the paragraph at point between filled and unfilled.

You can customize this behavior by setting the list-variable ~unfill-functions~ in your emacs-config.
~unfill-cycle~ will then format the paragraph according to the first function on it's first call, to the second function on it's second consecutive call, etc.

    (setq unfill-functions (list 'fill-paragraph 'unfill-paragraph 'my-own-function-for-formating-paragraphs))
